# The Future is Our!
This is my bigger project so far! :P
Everything here is in form an exercise, but there's possibility it will be my first real site! (not portfolio)

# Used tools and adds
- VS Code
  - Live SASS compiler
  - Live server
- Figma - whole project has been designed in it

# To-do list:
- [x] Hamburger lines after click, change into X (and conversely)
- [x] Smooth scroll down-arrow button leads to the first section
- [ ] On active hamburger menu (in X pos), make it affixed (doesn't move when scrolling)
- [ ] Horizontal-scroll box section
- [ ] Add Media Queries (Responsive View)
